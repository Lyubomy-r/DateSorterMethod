# Simple DateSorterMethod.

Task conditions:
The implementation of this method should sort dates.
- The output should be in the following order:
- Dates with an 'r' in the month,
- sorted ascending (first to last),
- then dates without an 'r' in the month,
- sorted descending (last to first).
#### For example, October dates would come before May dates, because October has an 'r' in it. 

thus: (2004-07-01, 2005-01-02, 2007-01-01, 2032-05-03)
would sort to
 (2005-01-02, 2007-01-01, 2032-05-03, 2004-07-01)

 - @param unsortedDates - an unsorted list of dates 
 - @return the collection of dates now sorted as per the spec
